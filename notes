Ruby is a true OOP language (very difficulut to go procedural)
- Encapsilution
-- Bundle all data and methods together
-- Also hiding stuff that shouldn't be available
- Abstraction
-- share what matters, avoid what doesn't
- Inheritence
-- Super/subclass
-- Car --> Electric Car
-- Monster --> Vampire
-- Shape --> Square
- Polymorphism
-- Allows you to use the same code to do different things
-- in terms of interitence, you have a Shape --> Square, Shape --> Circle
-- shape.draw() AS OPPOSED TO drawSquare(), drawCircle()

- Ruby is a general puporse interpreted langauge (doesn't compile) like node, php, or python
- C based
- Easy to connect to a DB
- TONS of gems 
-- gems are --> node/npm, apt/ubuntu, brew/Mac, plugin/jQuery
